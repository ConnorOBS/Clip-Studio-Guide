# Clip-Studio-Guide
This project is a markdown journal of my progress learning to use Clip Studio Paint. Each new entry is indicated by a new date and question. Adobe photoshop is too expensive as a monthly subscription,
so I bought a version of Clip Studio Paint. I will find out if it is a good alternative to photoshop for my needs as a beginner digital artist. 

UPDATE: Clip Studio Paint is going to a subscription style service, like Adobe Photoshop. So my reason for exploring this alternative graphics editor is gone. Oh well, was a fun experiement while it lasted, unfortunately Photoshop is still more versatile and powerful than Clip Studio Paint, so I won't continue using Clip Studio Paint in 2023 and beyond.
