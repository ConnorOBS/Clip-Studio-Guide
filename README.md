# Clip-Studio-Guide
This project is a markdown journal of my progress learning to use Clip Studio Paint. Each new entry is indicated by a new date and question. Adobe photoshop is too expensive as a monthly subscription,
so I bought a version of Clip Studio Paint. I will find out if it is a good alternative to photoshop for my needs as a beginner digital artist.
